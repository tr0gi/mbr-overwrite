## MBR Overwrite
Tiny Rust program which overwrites the Master Boot Record with a custom x86 real mode assembly bootloader and displays "System Halted". I plan on making this into an actual bootkit in the future.

## WARNING
This program will overwrite the Master Boot Record located on your boot drive, if you don't know what this means, you should not use this repository.
